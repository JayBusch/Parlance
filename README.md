# Parlance
Python Asynchronous ReLay ANd Chat Experience

This is an experiment in Python 3, providing a fully asynchronous, multiprocessed chat server.

It runs simply as "python3 parlance.py" or "python3 parlance.py -h" for command line options.

Hopefully this will serve as a good example of asynchronous multiprocessed socket programming in Python 3
for anyone who could use such an example.

There is NO security, NO authentication mechanism, and NO warranty is implied or given.

Deploy and use at your own risk.
